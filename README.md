## Deployment
-The project is hosted on [GitHub Pages]

-The process involved:
- Host a git repository on GitHub. Explained 
- The root folder contains README.md and index.html files
- On GitHub repository settings page move to GitHub Pages section
- Change source to master branch. (Or any desired branch)
- Provided link will be your projects home (index) page.
 
- To deploy your own version of the website:
- Have git installed
- Visit the repository
- Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http
- Open your chosen IDE (Cloud9, Gitpod, etc.)
- Open a terminal in your root directory
- Type 'git clone ' followed by the code taken from github repository
- When this completes you have your own version of the website
- Feel free to make any changes to it
- The website can be run by opening one of the HTML files within a web browser

A benefit of hosting the website on GitHub pages is any pushed changes to the project are updated on the website. 
Development branches can be created and merged to the master when complete.
some changes can be a little bit slow and causes some frustration.

During development the site was written using Gitpod.
